The default installation folder, <VS>, is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0.

1. Quit Visual Studio if it is running.
2. Copy IllustratorSDKdefault.vcxproj to <VS>\VC\VCWizards\.
3. Copy the folder <SDK>\samplecode\Templates\Win\IllustratorSDK\ to
<VS>\VC\VCWizards\AppWiz\.
4. Copy the file IllustratorSDK.vsz to <VS>\VC\vcprojects\.
5. Create a new folder <VS>\VC\vcprojects\IllustratorSDK\, and copy the folder
IllustratorSDK.vsdir into the new folder.
6. Start Visual Studio.
7. Choose File > New > Project.
8. In the Project Types pane of the New Project dialog, select Visual C++ > IllustratorSDK.
9. In the Templates pane, select SDKProject.
10. Set the Name of the project to a name of your choice.
11. Set the Location of the project to the <SDK>\samplecode folder. (If you save to a different location, you
will have to update the relative paths.)
12. Ensure Create Directory For Solution is not checked. (If this option is selected, the relative paths will
have to be updated, as the project file will not be at the top level.)
13. Click OK.
14. Build the project and load it into Illustrator. See “Build the project” in “Creating a plug-in in Windows” in the getting started guide.
